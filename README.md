# Frontend Quiz Project

This is a small web project where I made a quiz using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The quiz is responsive (works on phone, tablet, and desktop), and it also shows random facts using a public API.

## What it does
- Shows multiple-choice questions
- Lets you go to the next or previous question
- Calculates your score at the end
- Can show random fun facts
- Looks good on different screen sizes

## Tools I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
